## How does it work?

Girlscript Summer Of Code is a 3-month long open source project under Girlscript India. In this Summer Of Code, all the registered participants would get an exquisite opportunity to interact with the mentors and the Organizing Team from 18th February 2020 to 29th February 2020.

In this period they can extract any help or can resolve any  sort of query or uncertainty that they might be having regarding the projects or itâ€™s implementation. The team and the mentors will endeavour to provide the required help from their best possible resources. From 1st March onwards, the mentors will be declaring  the issues of the Open Source Projects and the admins will be looking after the final structuring of the websites. If a participant is willing to work on a project, he/she will have to comment on the issue and make a pull request and if the mentor finds the work satisfactory, the participant would get the opportunity to work for the same.

The claiming of issues by the participants will be on a first come-first served basis. The participants would be continuously evaluated on all the projects that they contribute to and thereby the  mentors will have to maintain a leaderboard and submit a biweekly evaluation of their respective mentees.

After the conclusion of event on 31st May 2020 the leaderboards of the mentors would be taken into consideration by the organizing team for the final evaluation of the participants and the result would be declared by 15th June 2020.
